A simple media player made in Python using the PyQt5 module. Its a desktop application which can run songs and also display its metadata similar to any other media playback software. Many other functionalities will be added in future.

For running this app, install the following Python modules:-
1. pyqt5
2. pyqt5-tools
3. stagger
4. pillow

It can play only '.mp3' and '.wav' files for now. It uses DirectShow in Windows to play audio. Some '.mp3' and '.wav' files may not play due to incapability of DirectShow.
Any updates to the code is always welcomed. You can create a new branch and upload your edits. I'll check and merge it with master branch if everything works fine.

**** Some other modules may also be required. You can connect to me via Linkedin for more details on the same ****
