# PyMediaPlayer
A simple media player made in Python using the PyQt5 module. It is a desktop application which can play songs and also display its metadata similar to any other media playback software.

# Supported formats
It uses *Windows Media Foundation* in Windows platform, so it can play most of the supported audio formats such as **mp3, wav, aac, wma, m4a, ac3, amr, ts, flac**, .etc.

Some minor issues regarding some special formats can arise, but its all up to the media plugin that the host Operating System uses. This application is totally based on the host OS, so results can vary depending on the type and version of the host OS. 

Any contribution to this project will be highly appreciated.
