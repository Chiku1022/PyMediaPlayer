# PyMediaPlayer
A simple media player made in Python using the PyQt5 module. Its a desktop application which can run songs and also display its metadata similar to any other media playback software.

# Supported formats
It uses DirectShow in Windows platform, so it can play only 'mp3' and 'wav' files for now. Due to inconsistency of DirectShow, it may not be able to play some 'mp3' and 'wav' files.

This issue can be resolved if the audio files are pre-processed and converted to 'wav' before playing without requiring the converted files to be stored permanently on the storage.

Any contribution to this project will be highly appreciated.
